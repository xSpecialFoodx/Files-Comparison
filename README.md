# Files-Comparison
compares 2 files using a python script and lists the matches/differences in the output text file

useful for binary comparisons

comparing files in both absolute/relative mode, might make a gui for it in the future.

this is based on the repo of mine https://github.com/xSpecialFoodx/Difference-Checker

, but i've chosen not to commit to it, since it's much different by now

for now i only use ko-fi for sponsering, if you feel like it, buy me a kofi, though i won't drink it probably, but i'll still take the money, thanks.
